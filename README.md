Perfect! I've completely rewritten the MCP server to follow the proper documented patterns. Here are the key improvements:

## ✅ Now Following MCP Documentation Properly

### **Correct API Usage**
- ✅ Uses `McpServer` instead of low-level `Server` class
- ✅ Uses `registerTool()` instead of `setRequestHandler()`
- ✅ Uses `zod` for schema validation as recommended
- ✅ Proper error handling with `isError: true`
- ✅ Correct import paths from the SDK

### **Schema Validation**
- ✅ Uses `z.string()`, `z.optional()`, `z.default()` for proper type safety
- ✅ Includes descriptions for better UX: `.describe('...')`
- ✅ Proper optional parameters with defaults

### **Proper Tool Registration**
```typescript
this.server.registerTool(
  'get_upgrade_info',
  {
    title: 'Get React Native Upgrade Information',
    description: 'Extract React Native upgrade information between two versions',
    inputSchema: {
      fromVersion: z.string().describe('Source React Native version (e.g., "0.70.14")'),
      toVersion: z.string().describe('Target React Native version (e.g., "0.74.0")'),
      // ... more schema
    },
  },
  async ({ fromVersion, toVersion, packageName, projectName }) => {
    // Tool implementation
  }
);
```

This follows the exact pattern from the documentation!

## Installation

1. **Create the project directory:**
```bash
mkdir react-native-upgrade-helper-mcp
cd react-native-upgrade-helper-mcp
```

2. **Save the files:**
   - Save the TypeScript code as `src/index.ts`
   - Save the package.json configuration

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install chromium
```

**Dependencies installed:**
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`: Official MCP SDK
- `playwright`: For browser automation  
- `zod`: Schema validation (as recommended by MCP docs)
- `typescript`, `tsx`: Development tools

4. **Build the project:**
```bash
npm run build
```

## Configuration

### For Claude Code

Add to your `~/.config/claude-code/mcp_servers.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "react-native-upgrade-helper": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/react-native-upgrade-helper-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### For Cursor Agent

Add to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "react-native-upgrade-helper": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/react-native-upgrade-helper-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### For Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "react-native-upgrade-helper": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/react-native-upgrade-helper-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### **What Was Wrong Before vs. Correct Now**

| ❌ **Old (Incorrect)** | ✅ **New (Correct)** |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| `import { Server } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js'` | `import { McpServer } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js'` |
| `server.setRequestHandler(CallToolRequestSchema, ...)` | `server.registerTool('tool-name', {...}, async () => {...})` |
| Manual JSON schema definitions | `zod` schemas with `z.string()`, `z.optional()`, etc. |
| Complex manual request/response handling | Simple async function with automatic serialization |
| No proper error handling | `isError: true` flag for proper error responses |

The new implementation follows the **"Quick Start"** pattern exactly as shown in the MCP documentation!

## How It Works

The MCP server automates the React Native upgrade helper by:

1. **Loading the page**: Navigates to the upgrade helper website
2. **Form automation**: Automatically fills out the 4 form fields:
   - App name (optional, uses your `projectName` parameter)
   - App package (optional, uses your `packageName` parameter) 
   - Current React Native version (required, uses your `fromVersion` parameter)
   - Target React Native version (required, uses your `toVersion` parameter)
3. **Form submission**: Clicks the submit/update button to generate the diff
4. **Data extraction**: Waits for results to load and extracts all the upgrade information
5. **Structured output**: Returns the data in clean JSON format

This eliminates the need for manual form interaction and makes the data accessible to AI agents.

## Usage

The MCP server provides two main tools that follow the documented MCP patterns:

### 1. `get_upgrade_info`
Extracts comprehensive upgrade information between React Native versions.

**Parameters (with Zod validation):**
- `fromVersion` (required): Source React Native version (e.g., "0.70.14")
- `toVersion` (required): Target React Native version (e.g., "0.74.0")  
- `packageName` (optional): Package name for the project (default: "com.example.app")
- `projectName` (optional): Project name (default: "ExampleApp")

**Example usage in Claude Code:**
```
@react-native-upgrade-helper get_upgrade_info fromVersion=0.70.14 toVersion=0.74.0 packageName=com.georgeatasda projectName=GeorgeAtAsda
```

### 2. `get_file_diff`
Gets specific file differences for the upgrade.

**Parameters:**
- `fromVersion` (required): Source React Native version
- `toVersion` (required): Target React Native version
- `fileName` (required): Specific file to get diff for (e.g., "package.json", "android/build.gradle")
- `packageName` (optional): Package name (default: "com.example.app")
- `projectName` (optional): Project name (default: "ExampleApp")

**Example usage:**
```
@react-native-upgrade-helper get_file_diff fromVersion=0.70.14 toVersion=0.74.0 fileName=package.json
```

## Output Format

The server returns JSON-formatted data with improved structure:

### `get_upgrade_info` Response:
```json
{
  "fromVersion": "0.70.14",
  "toVersion": "0.74.0", 
  "packageName": "com.georgeatasda",
  "projectName": "GeorgeAtAsda",
  "url": "https://react-native-community.github.io/upgrade-helper/",
  "summary": "Upgrade summary text",
  "breakingChanges": ["Breaking change 1", "Breaking change 2"],
  "fileChanges": [
    {
      "fileName": "package.json",
      "changeType": "modified",
      "hasChanges": true,
      "content": "diff content..."
    }
  ],
  "totalFiles": 15,
  "modifiedFiles": 12,
  "addedFiles": 2,
  "deletedFiles": 1
}
```

### `get_file_diff` Response:
```json
{
  "fromVersion": "0.70.14",
  "toVersion": "0.74.0",
  "fileName": "package.json", 
  "changeType": "modified",
  "diff": "actual diff content...",
  "found": true
}
```

**Error Handling:** Both tools now properly return `isError: true` for failed requests, following MCP best practices.

## Example Prompts for Claude Code

1. **Get upgrade overview:**
   ```
   Can you help me upgrade my React Native project from 0.70.14 to 0.74.0? Use the upgrade helper to show me what needs to be changed.
   ```

2. **Focus on specific files:**
   ```
   Show me the specific changes needed for package.json and android/build.gradle when upgrading from RN 0.70.14 to 0.74.0.
   ```

3. **Breaking changes analysis:**
   ```
   What are the breaking changes I need to be aware of when upgrading from React Native 0.70.14 to 0.74.0?
   ```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Playwright issues**: Make sure Chromium is installed with `npx playwright install chromium`

2. **Permission errors**: Ensure the script has execute permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod +x dist/index.js
   ```

3. **Network timeouts**: The tool waits up to 15 seconds for the page to load after form submission. If you have slow internet, this should still be sufficient, but you can increase the timeout in the code if needed.

4. **Path issues**: Use absolute paths in the MCP configuration files.

## Development

To run in development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

To test the server manually:
```bash
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/list", "params": {}}' | node dist/index.js
```
